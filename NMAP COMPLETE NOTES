Nmap Tool Tryhackme Labs 
Overview about NMAP - It's a very powerful tool used for scanning web network and machines to check for the open ports and exploit them.

NMAP uses three types of scanning protocols or methods (Whatever)-
ARP - This method uses ARP requests for discovering Live Hosts...
ICMP - This method uses ICMP requests for finding live hosts.... 		( WE'LL DISCUSS LATER WHAT ARE THESE ALL METHODS )
TCP/UDP - This method uses TCP/UDP packets for finding live hosts....

								\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/	Structure of a NMAP Scan 	\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

													1. Enumerate Targets 
													2. Discover Live Hosts
													3. Reverse-DNS lookup
													4. Detect OS
													5. Detect Versions
													6. Find Open Ports
													7. Traceroutes
													8. Default Scripts
													9. Writes Output ( OPTIONAL )

Two Must Scanner That is related with NMAP scans

Some Useful Flags For NMAP 
-sL - It will show the detailed information about the scan targets
-n - It will skip Dns Resolving ( for example If u will type an ip Address 192.168.0.0 it will not convert it to any domain )
-sn - if u want nmap to scan for live hosts without scanning for ports then use this Flag.
-sn -PR	- only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning
-PR - To perform an ARP scan.


ARP SCANS 
How does ARP scans work?

At first, the pc1 sends a ARP request to the other pc and then pc2 sends an ARP response in return;
which indicates that the host is live or up
 
 
ICMP SCANS 
 
How does ICMP scans work?
 
pc1 sends a ICMP request and pc2 replies it with a ICMP reply which indicates that the host is live or up.
 
COMMANDS 
-PE - To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option -PE. 
												(Remember to add -sn if you don’t want to follow that with a port scan.)
-PP - For sending timestamps request to the network 
-PM - uses ICMP address mask in scanning			


TCP/SYN SCANS
How does TCP SYN work?

We can send a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default, and wait for a response.
An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset).

								/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ NMAP PORT STATES \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
								
    Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
    
	Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. 
	By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
    
	Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible.
	This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, 
	the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.
    
	Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. 
	This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA.
    
	Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
    
	Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.
	
	
	
	
	How does TCP scan works?
	
	At first, 
	
	1. The client sends a TCP packet with a SYN flag.
	2. Then the server responds with a SYN/ACK Flag.
	3. if the port is open; finally, the client completes the 3-way handshake by sending an ACK.
	
	NMAP command for TCP scan = -sT ( This will perform a TCP scan )
	
	NMAP -F ( Makes the scan faster by sending less number of packets )
	
	-r ( sorts the nmap ports order )
	
	How Does a SYN scan works?
	1. the client sends a SYN packet
	2. The server responds with a SYN/ACK Flag
	3. Then the server responds RST FLAG
	
	
	How does a UDP scan works?
	
	In this particular scan type there are no flags sent in packets 
	instead, The client sends a UDP packet ( if the port is open no response is expected ) 
	( IF THE PORT IS CLOSE THE SERVER REPSONDS WITH A ICMP PACKER ERROR TYPE 3 )
	
	
	BASIC NMAP STRUCTURE 
	
    port list: -p22,80,443 will scan ports 22, 80 and 443.
    port range: -p1-1023 will scan all ports between 1 and 1023 inclusive, while -p20-25 will scan ports between 20 and 25 inclusive.


	--top-ports 10 - ( IT WILL SCAN FOR TOP 10 COMMON PORTS)
	To control the timing of NMAP scans This flag is used 
	-T0, -T1, -T3, -T4, -T5, -T6 
	--min-rate <number> ( NUMBER OF PACKETS SENT IN A SECOND ) 
	
	
						/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\  NMAP ALL SCANS SYNTAX  /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
						
										Port Scan Type 	Example Command
										TCP Connect Scan 	nmap -sT 10.10.76.108
										TCP SYN Scan 	sudo nmap -sS 10.10.76.108
										UDP Scan 	sudo nmap -sU 10.10.76.108
										
										These scan types should get you started discovering running TCP and UDP services on a target host.
										Option 	Purpose
										-p- 	all ports
										-p1-1023 	scan ports 1 to 1023
										-F 	100 most common ports
										-r 	scan ports in consecutive order
										-T<0-5> 	-T0 being the slowest and T5 the fastest
										--max-rate 50 	rate <= 50 packets/sec
										--min-rate 15 	rate >= 15 packets/sec
										--min-parallelism 100 	at least 100 probes in parallel
										
										
										
How does a NULL Scan works?
1. Client sends a NULL with no flags and bit set to zero 
2. IF the server does not responds with any packets (then the port is open or filtered)
3. But if the server responds with a RST/ACK then the port is closed.

How does a FIN Scan works?
1. Client sends a FIN packet 
2. If the server doesn't responds with anything ( then the port is open  or filtered Similiarly happens with the NULL scan )
3. If it responds with a RST/ACK packet then the port is closed.

How does a XMASS Scan Works?
The server sends request with FIN,URG,PSH 
If it doesn't responds then the port is open or filtered.
otherwise if it responds then the port is closed ( BTW IT WILL RESPOND WITH A SYN/ACK FLAG )

How does a TCP ACK Scan works?
1. Client sends a ACK PACKET with a ACK flag in it and The server responds with a RST flag. ( regardless of the condition means no matter if the port
is open or closed the server will respond with a RST flag )


How does a WINDOWS TCP SCAN works?
1. Client sends a ACK flag 
2. and the server responds with a RST flag ( no matter what the state of the port is )

How does a custom scan works?
1. If you want to make scan level to the advance level by combining many scan types this type of scan is used.
--scanflags RSTSYNFIN ( This will send RST FLAG SYN AND FIN FLAG TO THE SERVER ) 

NMAP IP SCAN SPOOFING AND MAC ADDRESS SPOOFING 

-e ( For specifying the interface )
-Pn ( For skipping PING SCAN ) 
--spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC ( It will spoof the mac address )
-S ( it will spoof the IP Address )
-D ( TO perform the same scan from many IP ADDRESSES ) 
ME ( NOT A FLAG BUT USED IN DECOY SCAN -D TO STATE THAT IT's YOUR IP ADDRESS ) 


What is A firewall?
A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that blocks request fro a particular source or IP ADDRESS or A particular header 

What is IDS?
IDS ( INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM ) detects a maclious request with the help of the packets sent if the request of the packets increases it creates
an alert. ( HOW TO PREVENT IDS TO DETECT OUR NMAP SCAN ) 

Fragmented Packets 
If the IDS is stopping our scan from being run then Fragmented comes handy in place. 
-f ( TO Divide the packets in to 8 bytes ) 
-f -f ( 16 bytes Which is similar to -ff ) TO change deault default 8 byte use this command --mtu

--reason ( show why nmap performed this type of scan ) 
-v ( verbosity level ( INFORMATION LEVEL ) )  ( -vv ( MORE VERBOSITY ) )
-d ( debbuging details ) -dd ( more details )
